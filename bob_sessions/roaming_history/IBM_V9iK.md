## 3. Paragraph Format Export Test

### Test 3.1: Smart Truncation Session

**Command:** `python reboot.py --export bob_sessions/bob_task_may-16-2026_12-28-29-pm.md --format paragraph`  
**Exit Code:** 0 (Success)

**Output:**
```
============================================================
RESTORYE CONTEXT: Building smart truncation logic in reboot.py solves data loss by replacing equal splits with targeted extractions, preferring current method over simple splitting due to preserving crucial information like file changes and outcomes; Reboot.py modification now includes intelligent parsing but still requires testing on various exports which will be done next without considering reversion to previous simplistic methods given their shortcomings regarding retention of vital mid-session details.
============================================================
```

**Quality Assessment:** ✅ **EXCELLENT**
- Successfully generated flowing paragraph format
- Captured key technical concepts (smart truncation, targeted extractions)
- Explained rationale (preserving crucial information)
- Included current state (intelligent parsing implemented)
- Mentioned next steps (testing on various exports)
- Explained dead ends (not reverting to simplistic methods)
- Natural language flow with proper semicolon usage

**Note:** Minor typo "RESTORYE" instead of "RESTORE" in header - this appears to be an LLM generation quirk but doesn't impact functionality.

## 7. Recommendations

### Strengths to Highlight:
1. **Robust Testing:** Comprehensive unit test coverage (10 test categories)
2. **Smart Truncation:** Intelligent content preservation with keyword detection
3. **Security:** Built-in credential scanning prevents data leaks
4. **Flexibility:** Dual format support (structured/paragraph) for different use cases
5. **Edge Case Handling:** Gracefully handles minimal and extensive session data

### Minor Improvements (Optional):
1. Consider adding validation for the "RESTORYE" typo in paragraph format header
2. Could add progress indicators for long-running API calls
3. Consider adding a --dry-run mode for testing without API calls
