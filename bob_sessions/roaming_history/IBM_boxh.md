<attempt_completion>
<result>
Successfully replaced the entire contents of resume.py with the Session Resume Card code. The file now contains:
- IBM watsonx.ai integration for generating restoration strings from Bob session exports
- Configuration for API key, project ID, and model settings
- Functions for IAM token authentication and LLM-based text generation
- Command-line interface to process Bob session export markdown files
- Cognitive state extraction logic with specific instructions for the LLM
</result>
</attempt_completion>
